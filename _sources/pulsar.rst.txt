Analysing Pulsar Data
*********************

The subpackage ``stingray.pulse`` implements a set of tools for 
analysing (X-ray) pulsar data, in particular periodicity searches.

Many of these methods are generally applicable for searchsing for 
and analysing strictly periodic signals (with a possible frequency 
derivative) in the presence of instrumental noise. 

Below, we show examples of how this functionality can be implemented and 
used in practice.
